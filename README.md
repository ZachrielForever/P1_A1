# P1_A1

### A terminal-based hub for an interconnected AI network.

## About the Project
`P1_A1` is a powerful and resource-efficient program designed to provide a unified interface for interacting with multiple AI models. Developed on the **Bazzite** operating system, this project is built for the entire **Universal Blue (uBlue)** Linux ecosystem, focusing on a clean and intuitive **TUI (Terminal User Interface)**.

The core philosophy of `P1_A1` is to **flatten complex AI workflows** into a seamless, unified experience. Instead of needing multiple software programs, users can access an interconnected network of locally hosted AIs through a single application. For example, a request for an image from an LLM can be seamlessly passed to the Diffusor model, allowing the user to switch modes and execute the task with the same prompt.

To conserve system resources, the program manages models dynamically, ensuring that only one is loaded into memory at any given time. This approach allows for a wide range of functionality without the overhead of running multiple processes.

### Key Features and Goals

* **Local-First & Offline Functionality:** This program is designed to be self-contained and requires **zero internet access** after initial setup, ensuring your data remains private and secure.
* **Dynamic Model Integration:** Supports seamless switching between different AI models, all within a single TUI.
* **Inter-Model Communication:** The program is designed to allow AIs to interact with each other, saving users from manual context-switching.
* **End-User Focused:** The project is intended for individuals and end-users, not corporations.

### Planned AI Integrations
We plan to include a diverse set of AI models to create a robust workflow:

* **Large Language Models (LLM)**
* **Diffusor** (Image Generation)
* **Upscaler** (Image Enhancement)
* **Video** (Processing & Generation)
* **Sound** (Audio Generation)
* **3D** (Model Generation)
* **Interrogator** (Image-to-Text)
* **On-Screen Recognition (OCR)** for direct interaction with the user's screen.

## Installation
*(This section is currently a placeholder as development is focused on core features.)*

## Usage
